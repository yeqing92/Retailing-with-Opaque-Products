## Python Code for Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 in paper

### Steps to generate Figures 3 and 4:
 1. Run ComputeProfitFigure34.py to compute the results for each demand scenario. Run multiple times until all the demand scenarios in Figures 3 and 4 are generated. Data will be saved in csv files.
 2. Use Figure3.py to regenerate Figure 3
 3. Use Figure4.py to regenerate Figure 4

### Steps to generate Figure 5 and 6:
- Run Figure5.py and Figure6.py
- The two files are almost identical except that S is 200 for Figure 5 and S is 400 for Figure 6. The search range for price and discount for the MNL avg demand was specified for each scenario.
